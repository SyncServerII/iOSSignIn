# iOSSignIn

The main iOS package for sign-ins for SyncServerII. The system underlying Neebla (Neeblablablah to you Bushy!).

Enables access to various integrated sign-ins (e.g., Dropbox, Facebook). It doesn't specifically connect with the SyncServerII network API. That is, the results generated by the `SignInManagerDelegate` defined in this package reflect the state of the UI and the state of specific signin's (e.g., iOSDropbox, iOSFacebook) and *not* the state of the SyncServer or the SyncServer network API.
